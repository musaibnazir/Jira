This repository is a collection of Jira scripts.  They require jira-python,
and currently depend on bugfixes in a fork. To check out this code, run:

git clone https://bitbucket.org/agrimm/jira-python.git

This code requires the python requests and tlslite libraries. I have mainly
tested it on Fedora 17, but upstream supports a wide variety of distros.

To run any scripts in this repository, you should set your PYTHONPATH variable:

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/jira-python:/path/to/jira-scripts

All scripts use jiraauth.py as a helper for authentication; that script in turn
expects to find a file at ~/.jira-python/jirashell.ini , with a format like:

[options]
server = https://eucalyptus.atlassian.net

[basic_auth]
username = agrimm
password = s3kr1t

Note that this same config file can be used to run jirashell from jira-python's
tools subdirectory.  jirashell provides an interactive jira client via ipython.
